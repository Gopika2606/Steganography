# Steganography: Secure Message Hiding in Images

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates the effective use of **steganography** to securely hide and retrieve messages within digital images. By leveraging **Python** and libraries like **OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL**, we ensure that sensitive information can be embedded and extracted seamlessly without visual alterations. The project provides a practical approach to data security, allowing confidential communication without raising suspicion.

## 🛡️ What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of **concealing information within digital media** to prevent detection. Unlike encryption, which scrambles data into an unreadable format, steganography ensures that data remains hidden in plain sight. This technique has been widely used for secure communication, watermarking, and digital forensics.

### **Usage in Cybersecurity**
- **Covert Communication**: Enables secure transmission of sensitive messages without raising suspicion.
- **Data Protection**: Used for embedding security information within images or audio files to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Digital Watermarking**: Ensures copyright protection by embedding ownership details within digital content.
- **Malware Concealment**: While unethical, attackers use steganography to hide malicious code inside files, making detection harder.
- **Forensic Investigations**: Law enforcement agencies use steganography to track illegal communications and recover hidden evidence.


## 🔧 How the Project Works
This project encodes a secret message into an image by modifying pixel values in a way that remains visually indistinguishable. The process follows these steps:
1. **Message Encoding**: 
   - The user provides a text message and a passcode.
   - The message is mapped to pixel values and embedded within an image.
   - The modified image is saved as an output file.
2. **Message Extraction**:
   - The recipient enters the correct passcode.
   - The system retrieves the hidden message by reversing the encoding process.
   - If the passcode is incorrect, access is denied
     
## 🚀 Features
- **Secure Message Encoding**: Hide text messages inside images.
- **Message Extraction**: Retrieve hidden messages without data loss.
- **Encryption Support**: Optional encryption for added security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line or GUI-based implementation.
- **Supports Multiple Formats**: Works with PNG, JPEG, and BMP images.
